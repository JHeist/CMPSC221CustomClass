Create a Chatbot or another class that includes 3 or more properties (i.e. member variables) and 3 or more member functions (i.e. methods or behavior). Use those members in a non-trivial way. 

Note that the name of the public class should be Main (per repl.it's rules). But you may be required or compelled in the name of OOP to have multiple classes. 

As always, follow the class Coding Standards.
